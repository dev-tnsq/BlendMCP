## ü§ñ How to Connect Your AI Assistant

- **ChatGPT, Claude, or Custom Bot:**
  - Point your assistant to the MCP server endpoint.
  - Provide your Stellar secret key (AGENT_SECRET) for transaction signing.
  - Issue natural language commands, e.g.:
    - "Lend 100 USDC to Pool X"
    - "Analyze Pool Y and tell me if it's safe to lend"
    - "If safe, lend 40% of my XLM to Pool Y"
    - "Buy this NFT and pay later using Blend"

---

## üß† Example Advanced Queries

- "Analyze Pool X for risk, and if it's safe, lend 40% of my XLM."
- "Create a new pool, add a reserve, and lend 100 USDC."
- "Borrow from Pool Y, buy an NFT, and set up a repayment plan."
- "Show me my current positions and risk exposure."
